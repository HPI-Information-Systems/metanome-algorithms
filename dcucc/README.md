===============================================

The source repository of the DoCU algorithm

The DoCu algorithm is an algorithm to discover conditional unique column combination. 
The algorithm is compatible to the metanome framework which can be found under https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome.

To execute the algorithm, download the metanome deployment-0.0.2 snapshot from https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/naumann/sites/metanome/files/.
Copy the algorithm jar into the algorithm folder and start metanome. The algorithm should be shown in the GUI.

The algorithm is a maven project and can, therefore, be created with:

```mvn package```

I developed the DoCU algorithm as part of my master's thesis.
